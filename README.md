# Game Rules  

Weld 4 is a four player simulation of the board game connect 4. 

## Equipment:

However, since it is a four player game, initial game order will be blue,red,yellow, and green. Power-ups can be used before a players turn. 


## Game Play: 

Each turn, a player will place a disc in one of the 9 columns. There are 4 playable power-ups players can use before their turn: teleport a chip, rewind, column blocker, and bomb. 


## Objective:  
A player will win the game once they place 4 consecutive discs in a row, diagonal line or column. If there is a draw, the game will restart.
